# Implementation plan

## Make tasks actionable

Use short task IDs such as T1. Each task needs: purpose, existing/planned files, implementation steps, prerequisites, linked requirements/security controls, and a test or observable done condition. Keep these details together in tasks.md for Spec Kit, or implementation.md for a standalone plan. A title such as “Implement backend” is not enough.

Sequence contract/data preparation, core behavior, adapters/UI, testing and release by actual dependencies. Keep tasks small enough to review. Include cleanup only when needed for this feature. Do not generate tickets or assign people unless asked. If a review finding is a prerequisite, link its existing finding rather than restating it.

Keep one compact requirement coverage table: requirement, task(s), validation. Write the requirement itself only in spec.md for Spec Kit, or README.md for a standalone plan. For Spec Kit, keep contracts in its contracts/ files when present; otherwise use the design document. Put detailed security risks/controls only in their chosen section or security.md. Tasks reference them by readable links.

## Plan useful tests

Choose checks based on risk, not a fixed quota. Cover changed business rules, negative/permission cases, contract compatibility, integration boundaries, database upgrades, UI interactions, concurrency/retries and recovery where applicable. Explain setup, action and expected outcome. Use synthetic fixtures, not production personal data.

Distinguish existing tests to extend from planned tests. Include both fresh install and upgrade paths for relevant schema changes, old/new application coexistence, existing invalid data, partial failure and retry recovery. Do not claim any test passed unless run and recorded. Static inspection is not performance measurement; say what measurement would settle a performance assumption.

## Plan release and recovery

Explain preparation, data prechecks, configuration, deployment sequence, backfill/reconciliation, verification, monitoring and cleanup. Decide whether a feature flag helps and who/what activates it without inventing a named owner. Tie release gates to observable outcomes.

State compatibility during rollout. Identify lock/rewrite and resource risks using the actual database/version and known data size. Avoid an unconditional zero-downtime claim. A rollback script cannot restore deleted data by itself; specify restore requirements or forward recovery and any point after which rollback is unsafe.

## Check readiness

Every accepted requirement has a task and a way to verify it. Every important security risk has a control and a test. Every breaking change has a transition plan. Every unknown that changes the design is marked with the decision needed. Every diagram/contract agrees with the task list. Remove repeated explanations and keep the plan readable.
