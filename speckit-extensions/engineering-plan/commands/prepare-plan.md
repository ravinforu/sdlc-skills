description: Prepare Engineering Plan guidance before plan

# Prepare plan

Read `.specify/extensions/engineering-plan/guide/hooks.md` and follow its shared rules.

Resolve the current feature and read spec.md, the constitution, affected code, callers, tests and repository standards. Prepare the design concerns, security controls, compatibility and rollout needs for the core planning step. Do not overwrite artifacts or create a second plan. The design post-hook will complete and check the resulting artifacts.

Apply the **Plan** guidance in the stage map. Return a concise context/check result to the calling stage. Do not invoke another Spec Kit command.
